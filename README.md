PROJECT TITLE: Card Game

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This is a multi-player Card Game designed on the basis that the players are
dealt four cards each, and there are four cards in each player deck.
The players pick up a card from their deck, add it to their hand, and then pass a card from 
their hand to the next deck. Each player should have four cards after every turn, and there 
should be 4 cards in every deck.
The game is won when a player has a hand of 4 cards.

USER INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Run the project via the executable file CardGame.java
2. Input the number of players
3. Input the path to the .txt pack file relative to the file CardGame.java. 
    E.g. File: 4pWinDeck Input: '../testFiles/4pWinDeck.txt'
4. The terminal will output the winner of the game and then say that the game is over 
ex.

***                  Game Over                 ***
5. The Card Game will write output files to the folder 'outputFiles' which will document the
pickup and put down of cards for each player and their hand after each turn. These output files
are named deck1_output.txt or player1_output.txt etc. The Deck output files will only have 
one line indicating the final cards in that deck. The winning player n will be announced in each
output file, followed by each player exiting along with their hand upon exit.
